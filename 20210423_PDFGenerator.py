# Python program to convert text file to pdf

# SUMMARY OF HOW IT WORKS
# GUI pops-up to browse for file to be converted
# Inserts todays date at start of PDF
# Takes first line of PDF and applies Heading formatting
# When saving it will ask what filename to use
# Then it will ask which folder to save to

#For the moment there is no error handling and the program will fail if "Cancel" is selected at any point
